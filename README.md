 This is a light-weight network scanning tool
 When you are connected to a network activating this tool will give you the list of devices connected to it along with the ip addresses, Bssid and host name


 This one of my first projects related to Cyber-Security so I'm sorry if it isn't robust enough but with time I'm going to improve it. Feel free to use it and adjust rectify it as per the requirement
 Thanks !!!
