#for me:- I had to try a lot of ways to get the python nmap package so here I went ballistic so that you don't have to try different approach just brute-force all the possible combinations

pip3 install python-nmap
sudo pip3 install python-nmap
sudo apt-get install python3-nmap
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip nmap
pip3 install python-nmap scapy
